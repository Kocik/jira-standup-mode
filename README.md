# Jira Standup Mode
CSS styles to remove clutter and show what is most important for standup.

Use a browser addon that allows you to manage custom styles for websites - like [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). In the addon create a stylesheet for Jira and copypaste the content of `jira-standup-mode.css` from this repo.

You customize your styles by removing parts of my stylesheet (some of them may be specific to my preferences, eg. we are not using epics in my team, so I removed it from the task view), or add your own rules to it.
