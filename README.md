# Jira Standup Mode
CSS styles to remove clutter and show what is most important for standup.

# Usage

1. Use a browser addon that allows you to manage custom styles for websites - like [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). 
2. In the addon create a stylesheet for Jira and copypaste the content of `jira-standup-mode.css` from this repo.
3. You customize your styles by removing parts of my stylesheet, or add your own rules to it.

_You may want to adapt some of the rules - eg. we are not using epics in my team, so I removed "Add epic" button from the task view_
